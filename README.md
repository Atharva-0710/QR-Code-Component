## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This project helped me to brush up my basics of HTML and CSS such as centering the section vertically and horizontally and making the website responsive using media queries.
I centered the section horizontally using margin: auto;


### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for understanding how border-radius property works. I really liked there way of explaining.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This website has amazing article which helped me finally understand centering myy section. I'd recommend it to anyone who are beginners to front-end development.
